To characterize the audio aura of a listener based on their top 100 songs from 2018, we can calculate the average values of various audio features such as danceability, energy, key, loudness, speechiness, valence, and tempo. However, this method might not be very representative of the listener's musical tastes and preferences due to factors such as changes in taste over time, different moods or situations, and unequal importance of audio features. To address these limitations, we can propose alternative methods such as using a larger and more diverse sample of the listener's favorite songs, weighting the audio features based on their importance to the listener, clustering the songs into different categories based on their audio features, and incorporating additional data sources such as social media activity or music streaming history. These methods can help us capture the full range of the listener's musical tastes and preferences and provide a more accurate and personalized audio aura.
